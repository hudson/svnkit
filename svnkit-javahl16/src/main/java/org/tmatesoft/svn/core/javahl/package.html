This package provides an implementation of the native Subversion javahl 
binding interface <b>SVNClientInterface</b> that is distributed within
the <b>org.tigris.subversion.javahl</b> package. This implementation - 
called <b>SVNClientImpl</b> - is a replacement for the Subversion's default one - 
<b>SVNClient</b> (also distributed in <b>org.tigris.subversion.javahl</b>). 
The main difference between these implementations concludes in that the 
native <i>javahl</i> binding class <b>SVNClient</b> uses system dependent 
native libraries (in most cases a user need to build those libraries by himself)
while SVNKit solution - <b>SVNClientImpl</b> - uses the SVNKit library itself
which is an absolutely pure Java client library that has no native dependancies.
