/**
 * The <b>ISVNAuthenticationProvider</b> interface is implemented by user 
 * credentials providers. Such a provider is set to an authentication manager 
 * calling {@link ISVNAuthenticationManager#setAuthenticationProvider(ISVNAuthenticationProvider) setAuthenticationProvider()}.  
 * When a repository server pulls user's credentials, an <b>SVNRepository</b> driver 
 * asks the registered <b>ISVNAuthenticationManager</b> for credentials. The auth manager in its turn 
 * will ask the registered auth provider for credentials.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>ISVNAuthenticationProvider</b> may be implemented to keep a list of credentials, for example, there is 
 * such a default SVNKit implementation (that comes along with a default implementation of 
 * <b>ISVNAuthenticationManager</b> - <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.internal.wc.DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager</b>),  
 * that saves credentials in and retrieves them from the in-memory cache only during runtime (not on the disk); 
 * or the default one that uses the auth area cache (read the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn-book.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache">Subversion book chapter</a>).
