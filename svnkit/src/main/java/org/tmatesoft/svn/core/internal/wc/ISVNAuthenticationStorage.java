/**
 * The <b>ISVNAuthenticationStorage</b> interface is used to implement custom 
 * runtime authentication storage managers, that are responsible for caching 
 * user credentials as well as for retrieving cached credentials from the 
 * storage of a preferable type (it may be an in-memory cache, or a disk cache).
 * 
 * <p>
 * To make an authentication manager use your custom auth storage manager, 
 * provide it to the {@link org.tmatesoft.svn.core.internal.wc.DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager#setRuntimeStorage(ISVNAuthenticationStorage) setRuntimeStorage()}
 * method of the authentication manager. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * A default implementation of <b>ISVNAuthenticationStorage</b> (that comes along 
 * with a default implementation of <b>ISVNAuthenticationManager</b> - <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.internal.wc.DefaultSVNAuthenticationManager</b>) 
 * caches credentials only in the memory (not in the filesystem) during runtime. This feature is handy especially when 
 * on-disk caching is disabled in the standard <i>config</i> file (option <span class="javastring">"store-auth-creds"</span> is <span class="javastring">"no"</span>).
