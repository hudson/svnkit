/**
 * The <b>ISVNReporter</b> interface provides methods to describe
 * the state of local paths in order to get the differences in revisions
 * between those local paths and what is actually in the repository.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>ISVNReporter</b> objects are used by <b>ISVNReporterBaton</b>
 * implementations, provided by callers of the <b>SVNRepository</b>'s update, 
 * switch, status, diff operations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Paths for report calls are relative to the target of the operation (that is the 
 * directory where the command was run). Report calls must be made in depth-first 
 * order: parents before children, all children of a parent before any
 * siblings of the parent.  The first report call must be a 
 * {@link #setPath(String, String, long, boolean) setPath()} with a path argument of
 * <span class="javastring">""</span> and a valid revision. If the target of the operation 
 * is locally deleted or missing, use the root path's revision. If the target of the operation is 
 * deleted or switched relative to the root path, follow up the initial 
 * {@link #setPath(String, String, long, boolean) setPath()} call with a
 * {@link #linkPath(SVNURL, String, String, long, boolean) linkPath()}
 * or {@link #deletePath(String) deletePath()} call with a path argument of 
 * <span class="javastring">""</span> to
 * indicate that. In no other case may there be two report
 * descriptions for the same path.  If the target of the operation is
 * a locally added file or directory (which previously did not exist),
 * it may be reported as having revision 0 or as having the parent
 * directory's revision.
 *
 * For more information on using reporters, please, read these on-line article: 
 * <a href="http://svnkit.com/kb/dev-guide-update-operation.html">Using ISVNReporter/ISVNEditor in update-related operations</a>
