This package contains the classes necessary for such purposes as: generating 
delta windows upon comparing target bytes against source ones (also may be 
vs. empty), applying delta windows to files, serializing windows to byte buffers.
</p>

<p>
Delta generator (<b>SVNDeltaGenerator</b>) is configurable to produce fixed size delta windows. 
A delta window (<b>SVNDiffWindow</b>) itself never keeps its entire set of 
decoded instructions (<b>SVNDiffInstruction</b> objects) in memory, but uses 
an iterator to access them in sequence. Also it's possible to use a single instruction 
object template to access window instructions in sequence - by simply changing 
properties of the same instruction object per iteration.
