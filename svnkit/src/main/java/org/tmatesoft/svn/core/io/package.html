This package provides a low-level API for direct interacting with a Subversion repository on
the SVN protocol level.
The main class which manages all the repository access related work is <b>SVNRepository</b>. 
This class provides a developer a flexible interface which allows the developer not only to 
perform all basic SVN commands (such as checkout, commit, update, etc.) but to control 
those commands as well relying upon developer's implementations of <b>ISVNReporter</b>,<b>ISVNEditor</b> and
other interfaces which are accepted by most of major methods of <b>SVNRepository</b>. 
</p>
<p>
In the first place <b>SVNRepository</b> as well as the entire low-level API 
is intended for customizing developer's work with an SVN repository. So it has 
not the concept of Working Copy in its functionality.
