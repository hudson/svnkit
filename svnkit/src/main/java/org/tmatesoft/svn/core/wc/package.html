This package provides a high-level API for managing Working Copies in a way 
compatible with the native SVN command line client. That means if you
use <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b> to operate on Working Copy files, directories
and their properties you won't loose a compatibility with the SVN client - 
as if the copy items were managed by the SVN itself. In addition the package
classes and interfaces provide a developer a high flexibility in usage: all SVN 
client's commands are mapped to methods of <b>SVN</b>*<b>Client</b> classes which are 
responsible for all version control functionality (dealing either with Working Copies 
or URLs). This functionality is logicaly allotted to separate classes, so that, for 
example, all update related operations (update, switch, etc.) are handled by the same 
class. And * for each of these classes is the name of that functional behaviour the 
class is intended for - such as <b>SVNUpdateClient</b> or <b>SVNCommitClient</b>. To 
have even more flexibility there's a kind of a manager class - <b>SVNClientManager</b> 
- which aggregates all of these 'client' classes making developer's work easier and 
more comfortable. At last the high-level API is even a bit more than just an implementation 
of the SVN client's operations:
<ul>
<li> the package gives a developer an ability to implement several types of operation 
handlers that can be passed to some of <b>SVN</b>*<b>Client</b>'s methods , thus the developer
can 'take part' in operation processing;
<li> some of <b>SVN</b>*<b>Client</b> classes have methods for which the SVN command line client
has no analogues 
(such as the entire <A HREF="../../../../../org/tmatesoft/svn/core/wc/SVNMoveClient.html">
SVNMoveClient</A> class).
</ul>
</p>
<p>
While the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</b> represents a low-level API and therefore
'knows' nothing of the SVN native 'Working Copy' format and structure, 
<b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b> is contrarily a kind of a Java implementation of the SVN
client's commands which can be used in a standalone Java application that needs to work with 
Working Copies. However if a developer has no need or even don't want to have Working 
Copies but something else (for instance, in case of an own client side version control system
specific to developer's needs) the developer should refer to <B><A HREF="../io/package-summary.html">org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</A></B> 
rather than to <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b>.
