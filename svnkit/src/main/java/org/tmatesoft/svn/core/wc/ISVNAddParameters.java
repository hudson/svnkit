/**
 * The <b>ISVNAddParameters</b> is an interface for a callback which is invoked 
 * when there are inconsistent EOLs found in text files which are being scheduled for addition.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In other words, if a text file is scheduled for addition and an autoproperty 
 * {@link org.tmatesoft.svn.core.SVNProperty#EOL_STYLE} is set on a file that will cause an exception 
 * on files with inconsistent EOLs. In this case if the caller has provided his <code>ISVNAddParameters</code> 
 * its method <code>onInconsistentEOLs(File file)</code> will be called for that file. This method returns one of
 * the three constants predefined in this interface. According to the return value the file may be added as-is, as 
 * binary or addition may be cancelled and an exception may be thrown indicating an error.
