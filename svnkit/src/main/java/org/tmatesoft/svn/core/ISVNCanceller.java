 * The <b>ISVNCanceller</b> interface is used in <code>SVNKit</code> for cancelling operations. 
 * To cancel a running operation an implementor should throw an {@link SVNCancelException} from his 
 * <code>checkCancelled()</code> implementation. This method is called in plenty of <code>SVNKit</code> 
 * methods to give a user a chance to cancel a current running operation. For example, it could be a GUI 
 * application where a 'cancel' button would make the implementor's <code>checkCancelled()</code> method 
 * throw such an exception.
