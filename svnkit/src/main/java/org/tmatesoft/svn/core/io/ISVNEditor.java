/**
 * The <b>ISVNEditor</b> interface is used by <b>SVNRepository</b> to 
 * update versioned files/dirs, check out files/dirs from a repository, 
 * commit changes to a repository, take status of files/dirs,
 * get differences between files.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When used for updating (checking out, getting differences or status), an 
 * implementor should provide its own appropriate implementation of the 
 * <b>ISVNEditor</b> interface along with a reporter baton (<b>ISVNReposrterBaton</b>)
 * to a corresponding method of an <b>SVNRepository</b> driver. Reporter baton
 * will be used to describe the state of local dirs/files - their current revisions,
 * whether a file/dir is deleted or switched. An editor is invoked after the reporter 
 * baton finishes its work. It is used to "edit" the state of files/dirs, where
 * "edit" may mean anything: applying changes in updating, switching, checking out (what 
 * really changes the state), or handling changes in getting status or differences (what is 
 * only used to inform about, show, separately store changes, and so on). The concrete behaviour
 * of the editor is implemented by the provider of that editor.      
 * 
 * <p>
 * The other kind of using <b>ISVNEditor</b> is committing changes to a repository.
 * Here an editor is given to a caller, and the caller himself describes the changes
 * of local files/dirs. All that collected info is then committed in a single transaction
 * when a caller invokes the {@link #closeEdit()} method of the editor.
 * 
 * For more information on using editors, please, read these on-line articles:
