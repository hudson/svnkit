/**
 * Provides some nice command-line stack operations.  This nail must
 * have the aliases "push" and "pop" associated with it in order to
 * work properly.
 * 
 * If the "push" command is used, each argument on the command line
 * is pushed onto the stack (in order) and the program returns
 * immediately.
 * 
 * If the "pop" command is used, the top item on the stack is displayed
 * to the client's stdout.  If the stack is empty, the client will
 * block until another process calls push.  If the nailgun server is
 * shutdown while pop is blocking, pop will cause the client to exit
 * with exit code 1.  This is thread-safe: you can have multiple
 * clients waiting on "pop" and only one of them (determined by the VM
 * and the magic of synchronization) will receive any one pushed item.
 *
